  <h2 id="Guitar Neck">Guitar Neck</h2>
<p>
The neck is the part of the guitar you interface with to articulate the notes. The quality of the instument comes down to the comfort, articulation and playability of the neck. Hence, I began with this first to see if it was doable, otherwise it might be a waste of time.<br>
<br>&emsp;

The neck began as a blank of maple wood, which has a dense grain and is lovely to work with. I opted for a cross-sawn blank, as opposed to a quarter-sawn plank. The downside is that rather than running consistantly in the same direction, the tendancy is for this wood to cup as it exchanges moisture with the environment. In the final guitar, this is stabilised by the steel truss rod inside the neck, hwowever it proved a challenge when building. <br>
<br>&emsp;

I planed the wood down to thickness (*) using a cheap No5 plane, which I had not yet figuired out how to sharpen correctly. However, after a few hours of planining I was able to achieve a slab with satisfactory flats on both sides.  Although when I came back, having removed the material, the blank cupped some more, I was able to mediate this. I designated the flattest face to be the side which glues to the fretboard, as the other side would be carved away later.

Carving the channel for the truss rod was one of the tasks which I though would be the most challenging by hand. However, this proved to be relatively simple to achieve with a 6 mm chisel. I first marked out a centerline along the wood, and pre-drilled a few guide holes to the correct depth.</p>

  I was then able to carve out the channel, so that a dual action truss rod could fit into the cavity. I eventually carved out a little extra space to fit the nut. Whilst the original stratocaster guitars did not have a dual action truss rod, I figured it would be easier to install and offer good stability. I chose to keep the access at the heel, instead of the tops, so i could avoid drilling the tricky access hole.
