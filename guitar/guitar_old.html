  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  Over the course of 2023-2024 I built an electric guitar with no woodworking experience. I had been inspired by reading about other beginners who had been able to build guitars, so I've written up my experience.

  <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
  <p> Stars aligning
    I had been watching videos of people making guitars on Youtube, and follwing the r/Luthier subreddit for some time. I really wanted to try it and there were a few things that made this the right time.

    I'm doing a PhD in physics which affords several luxuries: access to lab space and hand tools. Flexible free time. I had just come back from a few intense weeks working at a lab in florida, and it seemed like having a go at this hobby would be a good idea. I had enough for my thesis and could look into other stuff. I was concerned about spending too much money on something that wouldn't work. I bought a set of chisels and had a go on some scrap pine I found. Knowing that I would have more control on a piece of hardwood, I decided I could probably do okay.
 </p> 

  <h2 id="constraints">Constraints</h2>
  Didn't want to commit too early, so decided to use hand tools mostly
  Neck hardest so start on that.
  Didn't want to invest in too many tools.
  Hardest part was a sturdy bench.
  I can always learn to play slide.
  * Break down into lots of little problem solving tasks
I made a lot of the discisions along the way.
  I can work weekends and evenings, but often visiting Florence.
  Why a stratocaster.

  I had been playing the same electric guitar for 10 years, during which time I had come to appreciate the  Single coils.

  <h2 id="stratocaster">The Fender Stratocaster</h2>
  <img src="images/stratocaster_drawing.svg"  alt="stratocaster_drawing">
  <p>
    The Fender stratocaster is a classic electric guitar design which combined several important technical innovations. 
    Innovations: bassically a plank. Mass produced. Precision level. Lots of ways to correct. Bolt on neck. workhorse. Light, small scale length. Established design with resources. It's an organic shape which is simply and elegantly constructed from the requirements of the design
  </p>

  Biggest Challenges:
  neck feel. - just be as precise as I can
  Neck pocket- Screws and lt physics
  Fretting precision. - Tuning problems inherent, fractional errors, adjustable bridge, compare to wind, the guitar tuning problem
  Tuning stability - remove tremolo- also not how I play. (jazz)
  Hand tools as far as possible

What I wanted most: intimacy, to see my mistakes, something which will age



<h2 id="plan">Plan</h2>
Plans taken from the internet, mostly from 60s strats. 
<img src="images/neck_schematic.svg"  alt="neck_schematic">
The first decision was to use a rosewood fretboard glued on, as opposed to the classic maple fretboard. Although I love the skunk stripe on the back where the truss rod is inserted, I thought this would be hard to join. Also, If I mess up cutting the fret slots, then I don't have to replace whole neck. I opted for a "'60s-style" neck with the truss rod adjustment at the bottom. This was to avoid the tricky drilling a hole at an angle to access it from the top. For simplicity I used a modern dual action truss rod.

<img src="images/body_schematic.svg"  alt="body_schematic">

As for the body, my main concern was to have the right weight/feel. I craved tuning stability which is poor in my current guitar (bigsby), so I opted for a simple hardtail bridge. I do not use a tremolo in my style of playing. This choice also makes it easier to carve the body.

<h2 id="neck">Neck</h2>

<img src="images/plank.jpg"  alt="plank">
I opted for cross sawn wood, which is standard in many guitars.

At this stage I began to learn a lot about how much the wood moves as it comes to equillibrium with it's environment.


I bought the maple for the neck budgeting that if I cocked it up, I had only paid £25 for a day of fun. The first trick was to hand plane it down which was quite hard.

Cupping and moisture.


<img src="images/plank_with_holes.jpg"  alt="plank_with_holes">
I marked up the planed surface with a centerline and marked the length of the fretboard from the nut to the heel. Along the centerline, I established a 6 mm wide, 14 mm deep cavity for the truss rod. I first used a drill with a depth stop as a guide to the correct depth, before clearing out the channel with a chisel. This was my first time using a chisel, and I was really impressed at how I could achieve a relatively clean line by paying attention.
<img src="images/truss_rod_cavity.jpg"  alt="truss_rod_cavity">
After carving the channel a little wider at the heel to accomidate the adjustment nut, the truss rod slipped in snugly, lying flush with the surface.
<img src="images/plank_with_truss_rod.jpg"  alt="plank_with_truss_rod">
Next I sketched out the outline of the neck and the headstock, and began to remove material in small chunks with a hacksaw. Over many hours I spent the next week slowly removing material with a chisel, to reach the outline of the neck. Though this was not particularly efficient, nor effective, I used this as an opportunity to get a feel for using a chisel and the response of the grain to different techniques.
<img src="images/chopping_plank.jpg"  alt="chopping_plank">
<img src="images/chopped_plank.jpg"  alt="chopped_plank">

Unfortunately, I found that once I had removed the excess maple, the wood bowed a little, and I had to return to the plane to establish a true flat reference surface once again.
<img src="images/rough_cut_neck.jpg"  alt="rough_cut_neck">

<h2 id="fretboard">The Fretboard</h2>
At this point I decided things were going well enough to invest in a rosewood fretboard. This was much more difficult to plane flat, and I learned that the rosewood was much more oily.  I cut the fretboard taper to size with the hacksaw, and used the plane along the edges achieve a nice straight line for the final dimensions. The fretboard is traditionally slightly curved to fit the hand, so I opted for a 9.5" radius. The most common way to do this by hand is with a curved radius sanding block. I made a simple radiusing-jig by affixing two scraps of wood as rails to slide the radius sanding block along.
<img src="images/radiusing_jig.jpg"  alt="radiusing_jig">
<img src="images/radius_block.jpg"  alt="radius_block">
It was relatively hard to achieve an even radius without putting too much pressure in one area, and pretty soon I had reached the thickness I was aiming for and had to settle. Though this jig was not super satistfactory, I achieved some sort of radius (maybe not exactly 9.5"). Since guitars are made with many different, compound or even no- radius, I assumed that it would be not too big of a deal.
<img src="images/radiused_block.jpg"  alt="radiused_block">

Cutting the fret slots is one of the jobs that I had found most intimidating about guitar building, as it seems to require high-precision and is critical to the functionality of the final instrument. After thinking about this for a while there were two reasons that I thought this might be more approcheable than it seems. 

1. Firstly, the human ear can easily discriminate between two pitches in the lower register a semitone apart. Most people will even be able to hear half, or a quarter of a semitone's difference, but smaller than that and it can be difficult to percieve tuning differences. Using a digital calliper and a ruler, I was confident that I could mark out distances to a much higher precision than that, compared to the distance of the frets. Though the distance between the higher notes at the top of the fretboard is much shorter, it is also much harder to discriminate the pitches in this register. On the scale of my accuracy, small bends in the playing style are a much more dominant factor in the pitch intonation.

2. Secondly, the tuning of the guitar also has inherent comprimises due to the even-tempered tuning.

In the end I read somewhere that a particular saw on amazon had the correct kerf for fretting and was much cheaper than specific luthiery tools.
<img src="images/fret_slotting.jpg"  alt="fret_slotting">
I first made a cut to establish the position of the nut, which I then chiselled out further. From this zero-point, I used digital callipers and a steel ruler to mark out each fret with a scalpel. I computed the fret distances using an online calculator for a classic fender 26" scale-length. 
<img src="images/good_fret_slots.jpg"  alt="good_fret_slots">
Cutting the fret slots went okay mostly, however there were a couple that I cut slightly askew. I filled these in with superglue and sawdust I had saved from the radiusing. I have now learned that using PVA glue instead of superglue would not have left as dark of a line, but I like that you can see these little quirks that tell a story when you look closely.
<img src="images/redone_fret_slot.jpg"  alt="redone_fret_slot">
I measured out and marked holes for the fret markers, and I drilled these out using a drill press.
<img src="images/markers_drilled.jpg"  alt="markers_drilled">
In order to keep the fretboard and neck aligned when gluing, I drilled a pair of guide holes to pin the pieces together using cocktail sticks. The two holes were hidden in the nut, and at the 12th fret marker, so that they will be covered in the finished neck.
<img src="images/nut_pinholes.jpg"  alt="nut_pinholes">
<img src="images/nut_cocktailstick.jpg"  alt="nut_cocktailstick">
<img src="images/12th_fret_slot.jpg"  alt="12th_fret_slot">
While the traditional 'clay' fret markers were not in fact made of clay, I liked the idea I had seen online of using polymer clay to make these. I bought some 'flesh-coloured' FIMO clay, which I thought would be interesting with the tones of the wood and moulded it into a template I made by drilling out a sheet of aluminium. After curing this in the oven, I popped them out and superglued them in, filling the small gaps with more sawdust. After sanding these down, the markers absorbed some of the oil from the rosewood, tinting the colour in a really nice way. The outlines were also not perfectly circular, which gives it a feel I really like.
<img src="images/fimo.jpg"  alt="fimo">
<img src="images/fret_markers.jpg"  alt="fret_markers">
On test fitting the fretboard, I found that it needed a little notch to make room for the truss rod adjustment nut.
<img src="images/rough_neck_heel.jpg"  alt="rough_neck_heel">
While the faces of the neck were still flat, I drilled the holes for the tuners. I made a mistake while measuring out the positions, and the tuner for the A-string is actually out of line from the others. This is more clear from the back, and I was kind of annoyed at the time, but since it does not really affect the performance, I've come to find it charming.
<img src="images/tuner_holes_front.jpg"  alt="tuner_holes_front">
<img src="images/tuner_holes_back.jpg"  alt="tuner_holes_back">
I read somewhere that rattling of the truss rod in the neck can cause issues, and whether this is important or not, I decided to follow the crowd and glue it into the cavity using a silicone adhesive.
<img src="images/gluing_truss_rod.jpg"  alt="gluing_truss_rod">
After that had dried, I masked off the truss rod channel and liberally applied PVA glue to the face of the neck. With the two cocktail pick guides registered, I pressed on the fretboard and held the pieces together with a few clamps overnight.
<img src="images/masked_neck.jpg"  alt="masked_neck">
<img src="images/gluey_neck.jpg"  alt="gluey_neck">
With the fretboard now attached to the neck, I trimmed the maple back to the outline of the rosewood using chisels, files, rasps and even the laerge plane to keep the sides flat.
<img src="images/neck_side.jpg"  alt="neck_side">
When all was set, I glued in the last of the fret markers, hiding the pins.
<img src="images/12th_fret_finished.jpg"  alt="12th_fret_finished">
<img src="images/nut_glued.jpg"  alt="nut_glued">
Before shaping the neck, I marked out and drilled the smaller side dots on the drill press. Likewise, these were moulded from FIMO and set with superglue, before sanding down. At this point I learned that I had used some measurements for a guitar with a larger radius, leaving some more excess rosewood on the sides than I had expected. Even so, I still liked the look of the side dots going through the line where the maple and rosewood meets, the final neck thickness would be the same anyway.

<h2 id="carving">Carving the Neck</h2>

<img src="images/side_fret_dots.jpg"  alt="side_fret_dots">
I pencilled out the contours for the heel of the strat and the outline of the volute on the back of the headstock. Once again, this step was quite intimidating, because the playability of the instrument

<h2 id="body">Body</h2>
I considered pine too soft. Light american ash.
After my experience with planing the maple, I was happy to pay for pre-thicknessed-stable wood.
At this point I bought a router.

<h2 id="accounting">Accounting</h2>
The point of this is not to save money, but to craft something i love and learn about the craft. That being said the benchmark is a fender stratocaster MIM for about $600. YOu can't account for the hours. I had some tools already. My ceiling fell in, covering the cost of most of the guitar. Definitely value for money.

    The tone produced by the electric guitar is shaped mostly by the pickups and the amplifier. As this is so critical to the character of the instrument, I wanted to do this properly.

    I bought fender pickups of fb marketplace, which turned out to be the ones he'd taken out. No matter I still like them. I went "'50s style"- because I like the sound. expensive CTS pots. Rewired with solid cloth-lacquered wire, because it looks beautiful and is a pleasure to work with.

    Routed hole for a larger potentially gold foil.

    Considered wiring mods, but wanted to learn strat language first.

    Chose off white pots becuase I like how the off white tones work together.
