  <h2 id="stratocaster">The Fender Stratocaster</h2>
  <p>
    The Fender Stratocaster is arguably the archetypal electric guitar design - the first image which comes to mind when many people think of a guitar. Its ubiquity comes down to many factors, however an often overlooked aspect of its sucess comes from a series of design innovations. Much like it's predecessors such as the Fender Telecaster, the Stratocaster is a minimalist instrument, not far removed from two planks of wood screwed together.
    <br> &emsp;
    The combination of design innovations,  and marketing success led to the widespread adoption of the Stratocaster guitars across many genres of recorded music. Hence, the unique voice of the Stratocaster single coil pickups has become a difinitive sound.

    <br> &emsp;
    Since the design of the stratocaster is so well documented, and optimised for mass production this made it an excellent candidate to reproduce as my first build.

  <h2 id="design_choices">Design Choices</h2>
  <p>
  Over it 70 year production span, there have been many iterations of the Stratocaster design, with notable differences.
  <ul>
    <li>Rosewood</li>
    <li>Hard Tail</li>
    <li>Ash Body</li>
    <li>Hand Tools</li>
  </ul>

   Because I had no idea if I was going to be able to actually make a guitar, I began the project with small investment. 
   <br>&emsp;
   I chose to use hand tools to slowly get to know the properties of the wood. If I made a mistake, it should only be small. Learning to fix mistakes is the most important part of the craft.
   <br> &emsp;
   I was at first worried that the tuning would be difficult, however there were a couple of reasons that I thought it would be okay.
   Secondly, I though it could always become a slide guitar, or just a fun experience.
